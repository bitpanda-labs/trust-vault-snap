# TrustVault Snap

The TrustVault Snap is an account management layer on top of Bitpanda Custody EVM sub-wallets.
It facilitates the creations of transaction requests, that need to be confirmed and signed through the TrustVault signing process.
It allows for seamless interactions with Dapps, through the familiar Metamask flow, but with all the security guarantees of TrustVault signing.
